## what if application closes unexpectedly ?
 ##### **There are number of reasons why your application may close**
   1) If your application closes during start up then:
       - The application will generate a SettingsError.txt file, which will explain the reason why the application is not working
       - The application will generate a PermissionError.txt file, which will explain the
       reason why the application is not working.
       - The reason might be: invalid licence key, expired licence key, HFT Servers are down, Cannot connect to HFT Servers,
       you already have an active bot.
       - If the error says HFTServers are down, please reach us.
   2) If your application closes after start up then:
        - The application won't generate a text file, because problem is either you provided
        the wrong api keys or there is a problem with your internet connection.
